Feature: Share by public link
  As a user
  I want to share files through a publicly accessible link
  So that users who do not have an account on my ownCloud server can access them

  As an admin
  I want to limit the ability of a user to share files/folders through a publicly accessible link
  So that public sharing is limited according to organization policy

  Background:
    Given user "user1" has been created with default attributes

  Scenario Outline: simple sharing by public link
    Given user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user creates a new public link for resource "<shared-resource>" using the webUI
    Then user "user1" should have a share with these details:
      | field       | value              |
      | share_type  | public_link        |
      | uid_owner   | user1              |
      | permissions | read               |
      | path        | /<shared-resource> |
      | name        | Public link        |
    And a link named "Public link" should be listed with role "Viewer" in the public link list of resource "<shared-resource>" on the webUI
    When the public uses the webUI to access the last public link created by user "user1"
    Then file "lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    Examples:
      | shared-resource |
      | simple-folder   |
      | lorem.txt       |
